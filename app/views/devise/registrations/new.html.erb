			<h2>Is risk limitless too?</h2>

			<p>The good news is, it's not. There are a lot of scare tactics and myths out there that can leave us confused about how much risk our sex lives really involve: Can we get or give an STI from that? When should we get tested? What will happen if a test comes back positive?</p>
