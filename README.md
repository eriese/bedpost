# Bedpost
BedPost is a sex diary that helps users track their risk of sexually transmitted infection.

## Roadmap

### MVP
#### Functionality

- ~~Account CRUD~~
- ~~Account recovery~~
- Session Management
 - ~~Log in/Log out~~
 - Remember me
 - Session timeout
- ~~Partnership CRUD~~
- ~~Encounter CRUD~~
 - ~~Risk Evaluation on Encounter Review~~
 - ~~Testing Advice on Encounter Review~~
- STI factsheets on all STIs mentioned
- Guided first-time flow

#### Still needed
- Mailchimp integration
- Partnership risk calculation as part of encounter risk calculation
- Change password on edit profile page
- Views:
 - Dashboard
 - Review Partnership
- Localization/copy
- Testing
- Data entry about diagnoses/risks
- Back buttons everywhere
- Accessibility Audit
- Security Audit
- Guided flow system with flexibility for divergent paths
- Opt in on signup to have data used anonymously for research
- TOU

### Future
- input test results
 - eventually integrate with apps that receive results directly
 - eventually take existing diagnoses into account for risk calculation
- invite partner to BedPost using profile you already set up for them
- current risk overview page
- user setting for preferred testing schedule
- calendar integration for testing reminders
- text/email reminders for testing

### Far Future
- expanded user-inputed dictionary for more customized, less medical feel
- user settings to allow certain info to be shared with partners
 * share encounter so only one user needs to put it in
 * share test results for partner's risk calculations
- bookmark frequent activities to easily input into encounters
 * do this by prediction?
- hide/unhide activities you never participate in
- multiple partners in single encounter
- multiple pronouns
- prompt for re-evaluating relationship after time or frequent encounters
- track pregnancy risk
- multiple aliases in a single profile
