      why: &whys
        familiarity: Knowledge is power! Helping us understand how familiar you are with a person gives context to your other answers and helps us do the math correctly when it is time to calculate your risk.
        exclusivity: We're often told that this is one of the biggest determining factors when it comes to sex and risk, and here at BedPost we want to help you understand when exclusivity does and doesn't impact risk.
        trust: This one is a pretty broad concept, but this data helps us know how to weight your answers when it comes to exclusivity and prior discussion.
        communication: Communication is everything! Without details in this category, we couldn't weight your answers to any of our other questions accurately.
        prior_discussion: There is no perfect sexual practice that can 100% eliminate risk. We use this, as well as communication and trust, in our calculations to help you understand the risk specific to this partnership.
      tip: &tips
        familiarity: Pick the option that best reflects your relationship with the person. Go with your gut. The higher the score, the better you know them.
        exclusivity: We only care how exclusive this person is with you. Information about how many partners this person has will help us understand how risky they are as a partner to you. Don't worry, that's not the only factor we take into account.
        trust: Do you believe that what they tell you is true? This will help us decide how much weight to put on some of your other answers, so when in doubt, round down.
        communication: All forms of communication are valid! We don't care if you text, they slide into your DMs, or you wake up in the same room every day. Pick the one that feels like the best fit.
        prior_discussion: Risk management includes but isn't limited to - testing schedule, STI status, barrier practices, and fluid bonding and exchange philosophies. We'll ask you about barrier use some here too to help us assess risk.
