      why: &whys
        familiarity: Knowledge is power! Helping us understand how familiar you are with a person gives context to your other answers and helps us do the math correctly when it is time to do our calculations.
        exclusivity: We're often told that this is one of the biggest determining factors when it comes to sex and likelihood of infection, and we want to help you understand when exclusivity does and doesn't impact you.
        trust: This one is a pretty broad concept, but this data helps us know how to weight your answers when it comes to exclusivity and prior discussion.
        communication: Communication is everything! Without details in this category, we couldn't weight your answers to any of our other questions accurately.
        prior_discussion: This helps us get a glimpse into your partner's risk-managment philosophy. It can also help us better understand how to use your communication and trust data in our calculations.
      tip: &tips
        familiarity: Pick the option that best reflects your relationship with the person. Go with your gut. The higher the score, the better you know them.
        exclusivity: Think about your general barrier practices in this relationship, as well as what you know about their other sexual relationships. We'll still ask you about barriers in each encounter you log.
        trust: Do you believe that what they tell you is true? This will help us decide how much weight to put on some of your other answers, so when in doubt, round down.
        communication: All forms of communication are valid. Pick the one that feels like the best fit.
        prior_discussion: Risk management includes but isn't limited to - testing schedule, STI status, and barrier use practices.
