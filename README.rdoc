BedPost is an app that helps users track their risk of sexually transmitted infection by assessing user-inputted data about their sexual partners, sexual encounters, and medical test results. By keeping a careful and accurate account of their behaviors, users can easily keep a record of the risk-level of individual sexual encounters and their overall likelihood of infection given their habits. Additionally, users who input test data to see what their risk windows are for individual infections as well as which of their partners they have interacted with within those windows.

The goal of BedPost is to encourage a sex-positive approach to harm reduction within sexuality. As such, the app offers a simple, customizable, gender- and sexuality-neutral interface for recording one's sexual practices. Users have the option to specify their and their partners' preferred pronouns as well as the names they use to describe various body parts. The app makes limited assumptions about what constitutes a "valid" sex act, allowing users a huge variety of "sexual contact" options. Its algorithm for calculating risk takes the user's own assessment of the risks involved into account.
